# Palm-tree-climbing-bike

A bike has been created that can climb trees and carry out activities like spraying pesticides or picking dates. 
The three pneumatic actuators used for this climbing robot's mechanism include one primary actuator, two auxiliary actuators, two encircling arms, springs, and pneumatic valves.
The arms wrap the tree trunk, and the two auxiliary actuators, along with the two springs, will maintain the arms in place so that they may either lift the bike or support its weight. 
The valves govern the motion that comes from the main actuator, which is applied to the upper and lower arms to elevate the bike up the tree trunk. 
The utilised air pressure does not go over 6 bars. An Arduino controller directs the bike's movement as it ascends and descends.
Three 4-2-way pneumatic valves with spring return are used in the pneumatic circuit and are solenoid activated. Using a double Hybridge, a 12 Volt DC signal is used to power these valves. 
A 12V rechargeable battery with a 9V voltage regulator is used as the power supply for both the microcontroller and the solenoids.
